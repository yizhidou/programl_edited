    This is a convenience function for generating graphs of simple single-file

        #include <stdio.h>

        int main() {
            printf("Hello, ProGraML!");
            return 0;
        }
        EOF

    For more control over the clang invocation, see :func:`from_clang`.

    :param srcs: A string of C / C++, or an iterable sequence of strings of C /
        C++.

    :param copts: A list of additional command line arguments to pass to clang.

    :param system_includes: Detect and pass :code:`-isystem` arguments to clang
        using the default search path of the system compiler. See
        :func:`get_system_includes()
        <programl.util.py.cc_system_includes.get_system_includes>` for details.

    :param language: The programming language of :code:`srcs`. Must be either
        :code:`c++` or :code:`c`.

    :param version: The version of clang to use. See
        :code:`programl.CLANG_VERSIONS` for a list of available versions.

    :param timeout: The maximum number of seconds to wait for an individual
        clang invocation before raising an error. If multiple :code:`srcs`
        inputs are provided, this timeout is per-input.

    :param executor: An executor object, with method :code:`submit(callable,
        *args, **kwargs)` and returning a Future-like object with methods
        :code:`done() -> bool` and :code:`result() -> float`. The executor role
        is to dispatch the execution of the jobs locally/on a cluster/with
        multithreading depending on the implementation. Eg:
        :code:`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`. Defaults to single
        threaded execution. This is only used when multiple inputs are given.

    :param chunksize: The number of inputs to read and process at a time. A
        larger chunksize improves parallelism but increases memory consumption
        as more inputs must be stored in memory.

    :return: If :code:`srcs` is singular, returns a single
        :code:`programl.ProgramGraph` instance. Else returns a generator over
        :code:`programl.ProgramGraph` instances.

    :raises UnsupportedCompiler: If the requested compiler version is not
        supported.

    :raises GraphCreationError: If compilation of the input fails.

    :raises TimeoutError: If the specified timeout is reached.
