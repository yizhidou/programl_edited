"""ProGraML is a graph-based program representation for data flow analysis and
compiler optimizations.

The API is divided into three types of operations: graph *creation*, graph
*transformation*, and graph *serialization*, all available under the
:code:`programl` namespace.

ProGraML was first described in this `this paper
<https://chriscummins.cc/pub/2021-icml.pdf>`_:

    Cummins, C., Fisches, Z., Ben-Nun, T., Hoefler, T., O'Boyle, M., and
    Leather, H. "ProGraML: A Graph-based Program Representation for Data Flow
    Analysis and Compiler Optimizations." In 38th International Conference on
    Machine Learning (ICML).
